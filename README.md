# STOCK-PRICE-PREDICTION
 

Stock Price Prediction using python ðŸ“Š 

ðŸ“Œ Predicting the stock market has been the bane and goal of investors since its inception. Every day billions of dollars are traded on the stock exchange, and behind every dollar is an investor hoping to make a profit in one way or another. Here, challenge is to build a predictive model that can predict stock prices.

ðŸ“Œ In this project, I will discover and explore data from the stock market. I will learn how to visualize different aspects of it using Seaborn and Matplotlib. 

I will also be predicting future stock prices through a ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) method!

ðŸ“Œ Workflow stages:
The competition solution workflow goes through 5 stages,
1. Question or problem definition
2. Importing libraries
3. Loading the dataset
4. Generating Cumulative Returns and Autocorrelation plot.
5. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) for Time Series Prediction
